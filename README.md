# A-Pathfinding-Visualizer
This is a side project that I have been working on to gain more experience with java  
To run the program download A STAR PATHFINDING VISUALIZER.jar and run it  
**Controls:**  
-use scroll wheel to increase/decrese the grid  
-press escape to clear the grid  


Here is a screenshot of the program
